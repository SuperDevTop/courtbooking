Here is updated task list:
 

1.       Finalize implementing reservation functionality.

2.       Existing reservations should be editable.  Is it possible to use dragging to extend time of the reservation?  Drag down to extend time of the booking and drag up to make it shorter?

 

3.       Special options in addition to players can be assigned to booking.  Here are the options:

·        Looking

·        Prefers Coach

·        Coach

·        Hitting Partner

·        Looking Doubles

 

In the schedule especially Looking should stand out and be very easy to visually identify.

 

4.       Each player on the reservation should optionally have comments of two types:

Permeant and visible always and commentary visible for the current reservation only.  Comments are visible when player details are shown.

 

5.       Add flag to each player on the reservation to indicate Balls Given.

 

6.       Need to address the followings: How can new players get added?  How can details of the players get updated (their tournament status, match time)?

 

7.       Search functionality for scheduling
